# Visual-Studio-C-Application-template-Raylib-ImGui
A Raylib and ImGui template for C++ in Visual Studio

This is a project with good code architecture.
To use the template, you have to do is in the application folder navigate to the scenes and use the base scene or create a new class derived from Core::Scene and if you want that to be the main scene go to the main.cpp in core and change the current scene class to the one you made.
